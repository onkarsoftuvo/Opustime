If you are still on your trial, that's all there is to it.For those of you with an active account, changing plans will pro-rata credit you for the remainder of your current billing period. If changing to a plan of the same duration (eg. monthly or yearly), you will then be charged the pro-rata amount of the new plan for the remainder of your billing period. If you are changing to a different billing cycle, you'll still get pro-rata credited, but then we'll charge the full amount of your new plan and the billing date will be set ahead for a full period.If you're not sure what that means for you, just click the 'Select Plan' button above for your chosen plan, you will be shown exactly what is going to happen before you can then confirm.",
